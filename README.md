Puchunim
--------
Chaotically-driven, abstractly-typed, confusion-oriented library for solving problems. Probably.


Key Features
------------
- Full support for Pythonic snake rituals (since 2019)
- Transforms incomprehensible Excel sheets into magical dashboards
- Specialized in projects that start with "it's just a simple test"
- Includes built-in New Technology Learningâ„¢ API

Technologies
---------
`puchunim` can handle just about any kind of technology â€” but was primarily built using a few:

- **Python** (main core), for scripting, automation, discord bots and creative prototypes.
- **Excel + Power Query + VBA**, for automation, data analysis, dashboards and PowerPoint hacks.
- **Git & Github**, for version control with some funny commit messages
- **Linux**, for when the GUI gives up
- **MongoDB**, for saving the ideas for later
- **Give me any tool** â€” video, audio, image, or something weird â€” and Iâ€™ll probably make something work.

There are another techs involved in minor parts:

- **HTML / CSS / JS**
- **MySQL**
- **Ruby**

Implementation roadmap
----------------------

These features are still in beta (Planning to learn them):

- React, `useConfused()`
- Deep dive into VBA's obscure features
- Nim, pretty cool Python-like language

------------
